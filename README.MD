##Overview

I developed this with my kids and now we take it into Schools to introduce a
variety of concepts to the children and teachers.

It uses a cheap ESP8266 and i2c driven 8x8 LED Matrix. Both bought for under
Â£10.

The device acts as a wireless access point they connect to with an iPad (or any
other wifi device with a web browser) and can make the LED Matrix scroll
messages. They can also turn 8x8 drawings into binary, then convert to decimal
and send those numbers to see their design come up.
